# Deadpool Game
An exercise game for JS Advanced course at SoftUni with some tweaks from me.

In order to play the game, you need to enter your name. 
After you press 'Play', you will be in the role of Deadpool who is fighting Wolverine. 
In order to throw swords, you'll need to press the 'Space' button and when you kill an enemy with a sword, you gain additional points.
If you collide with a Wolverine, your health will decline, but you will not gain additional points. 
In case your health reaches 0, this will mean 'Game over' and you will be presented with some stats from your game, as well as a button that you can start a new game by.
