# Deadpool Game
An exercise game for JS Advanced course at SoftUni with some tweaks from me.

In order to play the game, you need to enter your name. 
After you press 'Play', you will be in the role of Deadpool who is fighting Wolverine. 
In order to throw swords, you'll need to press the 'Space' button.
If you collide with a Wolverine, your health will decline. 
In case your health reaches 0, this will mean 'Game over'.
